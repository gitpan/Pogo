Pogo - Perl GOODS interface
(C)1999-2004 Sey Nakajima <nakajima@netstock.co.jp>

This is a Perl inteface module for GOODS (Generic Object Oriented Database 
System). GOODS is written by Konstantin Knizhnik <knizhnik@altavista.net>.

This is a free software.

This module is in 'alpha' phase. All features may be changed.
Please send me your bug reports or suggestions.

I have developped and tested this on FreeBSD4.7 and FreeBSD4.9.
Please test in another OS and send me your porting informations.

Prepare GOODS 

  get goods-x.xx.tar.gz from any one of follows (x.xx is a revision number)
    http://www.garret.ru/~knizhnik/goods.html
    http://hp1.jonex.ne.jp/~nakajima.yasushi/

  NOTE: goods-2.74.tar.gz and goods-2.75.tar.gz has a bug. Please use
  2.76 or later.

  tar zxvf goods-x.xx.tar.gz
  cd goods
  ./config
  make
  su
  make install

  NOTE: GOODS has some makefiles corresponding to some OS's. Please do 
  './config -h'.

-----
Make,test and install Pogo

  tar zxvf Pogo-x.xx.tar.gz  (x.xx is a revision number)
  cd Pogo-x.xx
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  ./startgoodsrv test &
  make test
  ./cmdgoodsrv test exit
  su
  make install

  NOTE: You must use the Makefile.PL* corresponding to the GOODS makefile you
  used. Sorry, I do not offer all corresponding Makefile.PL to the GOODS 
  makefiles for now. If you met some errors, please edit Makefile.PL manually 
  considering to the GOODS makefile you used.

  A GOODS application needs running a server process 'goodsrv' with the 
  corresponding configuration file. Before executing test script, you must 
  run goodsrv with test.cfg. The command line './startgoodsrv test &' does 
  this as background process and './cmdgoodsrv test exit' terminates the 
  goodsrv.

  NOTE: If 'make test' fails with segmentation fault, try 
  'perl Makefile.PL -DGLOBALDB'.

-----
Database browser

  To browse the database of 'test.cfg', type as follows. See 'perldoc Pogo'
  for detail.

  ./startgoodsrv test &
  ./browse test
  ./cmdgoodsrv test exit

-----
Sample script

  There are some sample scripts in the sample directory. These scripts all 
  use 'sample.cfg'. So do 'startgoodsrv sample &' before executing sample 
  scripts.
